  <h1>Setting up an Ubuntu 16.04 server for remote access to do Deep learning on your local network
  </h1>
  <i>The back story is as follows.... On my desk I have a decent PC with a mediocre GPU, and I want to use a larger
    tower with a decent GPU in headless mode (no display) and stashed in a corner. I want to use a remote connection.
  </i>
  

  First off- I need to attribute the sources that I combined before going through my setup.<br>

  <h3>Step by Step instructions</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Set up the hdd partitions and install Ubuntu server as listed in Puget link above. Complete thru Step 4.</li>
    <li>Set up SSH on the server and connect from a second computer (unplug monitor when rebooting).</li>
    <li>Install CUDA and associated libraries as in Changjiang above, complete all the steps (note- there's a GOTCHA where one of the commands will fail and expects an explicit "Y"</li>
    <li>Setup the NVIDIA utities using the Puget blog post (From "Configure CUDA for use on your system" to the end.</li>
    <li>Validate that you have NVidia drivers installed by running 'nvidia-smi' from the terminal.This will confirm that your driver version is correct</li>
    <li>Validate that CUDA 9.0 is installed by running 'nvcc --version'</li>
    <li>Congrats - now it's time to install Python and other fun things. We'll go the Miniconda path</li>
    <li>Download the latest anaconda package and check the <a href="https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/hashes/all/">hash</a>
    <li>Run the installer and then use the coderwall instructions to get a remote connection to the notebook</li>
    <li>Open a notebook and confirm you can import the regular packages (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn)</li>
    <li>Install tensorflow as described <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_linux#InstallingAnaconda">here</a>.</li>
    <li>GOTCHA - jupyter notebook isn't installed by default- so import tensorflow fails. run this in the tensorflow venv "conda install jupyter"</li>
    <li>Validate that Tensorflow can be imported to the ipython notebook (also check that you are using the right interpreter using '!which python'</li>
    <li><a href="https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#cloning-an-environment">Clone</a> the environment into a new Keras env</li>
    <li>Activate the new environment and then perform 'pip install keras'</li>
    <li>Clone your tensorflow environment a second time to create an environment called pytorch</li>
    <li>Activate the pytorch environment and install pytorch using the command generated using the "start locally" section of the <a href="https://shiftlab.github.io/pytorch/get-started">pytorch page</a>, (e.g. 'conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch').</li>
