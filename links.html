  <h1>Things that are interesting that I've been learning
  </h1>

  <h2>Python</h2>
  <i>Back story- After finishing a PhD using fragile jupyter notebooks and losing weeks to
    associated poor methods I've been doing a ramp-up in proper software methods.</i><br>
  I like using `pip install` to install packages. I've been learning how to use <i><a
      href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/">python packaging</a></i>:
  <ul>
    <li>virtual environments for different Python versions, different projects, and different functions within a project
    </li>
    <li>python packaging to make my own source and wheel distributions, and putting them on a PyPi index</li>
  </ul>



  <h2>Metrology</h2>
  <p>I've been fortunate to enough to work with scientists in the metrology field. Specifically those at the UK <a
      href="https://www.npl.co.uk/">National Physics Laboratory</a>.</p>
  They have an elearning platform where I've been doing some <a href="https://elearning.npl.co.uk/"> elearning</a>.
  When I'm feeling ambitious I toil over the biblocal <a
    href="https://www.bipm.org/en/committees/jc/jcgm/publications">JCGM Publications: Guides in Metrology</a>.
