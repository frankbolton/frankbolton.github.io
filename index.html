This is the personal home page of Frank Bolton.<br />
Currently I wear two hats. 
I <b>work</b> at <a href="http://www.mobileodt.com/">MobileODT</a> as a Research Engineer, 
my days are mainly filled with designing and prototyping hardware for performing illumination and image capture for biophotonics applications.
Tools I make use of include:
<ul>
<li>Eagle PCB for schematics and board layouts
<li>MSP430 Microcontrollers using C (CCS)
<li>Fusion360 for CAD modelling for FDM 3d printing of enclosures
<li>Python and OpenCV for data logging of experiments
<li>(learning)Tensorflow with the idea of doing both deep learning and numerical methods (least squares curve fitting and Monte Carlo light transport modelling)
</ul>

I also <b>study</b>. I'm six years into a PhD in Industrial Engineering at Tel Aviv University. Under the supervision of Dr Eran Toch and Prof. Dov Te'Eni, we are developing and testing "Human aspects in Context Aware Interruption Management Systems". Tools I make use of here include:
<ul>
<li>Python Flask and HTML5 for generating web based HCI experiments
<li>Amazon Mechanical Turk for recruiting experiment participants
<li>R for data analysis, statistical testing and generating graphs
<li>Latex for paper writing
<li>Arduino and Processing for Ubicomp prototyping
</ul> 
I came to Israel to do a PhD, having been awarded a prestigious fellowship as part of a European Commission Framework Program 7 project called <a href="http://www.icarenet.eu/">iCareNet</a>.
